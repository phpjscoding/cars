### Car rental essential tips - from my personal experiences
If you don't want to read the entire article with the step-by-step to renting a car in Spain, here is a short summary of my top tips:

* My main recommendation is to choose a car that is not too wide. The overall roads are not a problem. However, if you visit older villages or old part of towns, the streets can be very narrow.
* Book early to get the best prices and the choice of cars
* Always check the car upon arrival and take pictures of anything you see (don't forget the roof and under the bumper)

## The booking platform I personally use

Throughout this article, you'll come across multiple references to Discovercars.com - my go-to car rental platform, which is highly rated by customers and is one of the best comparison sites available. Whenever I plan a trip and have confirmed the destination and dates, I immediately head to their site to browse their impressive selection of cars and deals.

On numerous occasions, I've been fortunate enough to score exceptional deals on their platform. What's more, their coverage options are both practical and affordable, providing ample protection against any potential exterior damage to the vehicle.

If you're interested in exploring the current car rental deals in Spain, I highly recommend checking out Discovercars.com. As for my personal experience, I rented a car from Enterprise at Sevilla Airport and the entire process went smoothly from start to finish.

# Is it difficult to drive in Spain? Is it safe?

In general, driving in Spain is a fairly common experience without any unique features. Similar to other places, navigating through the main towns can pose a challenge due to heavy traffic. However, the majority of the roads, including motorways, are well-maintained and in good condition. While there are mountainous routes, some of which may be narrow, they are equipped with proper safety measures. For more information on driving in Andalucia, be sure to peruse my comprehensive article on the topic.

## 1 to 3 - How to rent a car in Spain - required elements
## Tip 1 - License to rent a car in Spain

## Tip 2 - Extra age requirements / years of driving

While the legal driving age in Spain is 18, renting a car there may come with additional age requirements and driving experience. Typically, car rental companies in Spain mandate that renters be at least 21 years old and have held a driver's license in their home country for at least a year. Some companies may also impose surcharges on drivers who are under 25 or over a certain age. 

If you're unsure whether you meet these criteria,you can check Discovercars.com, which allows you to input your age and find out about any restrictions or extra fees associated with renting a car.

#### Tip 3 - A credit card that can handle the hold charge 
Remember that unless you have decided to purchase a full coverage insurance directly with the rental company, you will be asked for your credit card to hold a deposit. This amount s blocked on your account via your credit card (until you bring the car back without damages).
As it is on top of the payment, you may be hitting the limit of your credit card daily/weekly or monthly protection limit.
So be prepared! Your options are:

* Use a different credit card for the hold charge,
* Contact your bank prior to traveling to change your limits,
* Purchase a full coverage insurance with a 0 excess charge.

## On the platform Discovercars.com:

* once you open one option, you can click on Rental Conditions, and you will see the Security Deposit amount.
* And if this is an issue for you, you can pre-select the amount you are willing to have blocked as security deposit in the filters

# 4 & 5 - When and where to hire a car in Spain

## Tip 4 - Best period

Spain is a very popular destination, especially in Summer.
So, if you want the choice of your vehicle types and good prices, it is better to rent your car as early as possible.
You won't find any last-minute deals in Summer.
As soon as you have picked your dates, book the car!

## Tip 5 - When and where
Cars can be rented for all major towns, airports and ports.

If you plan on visiting a major town near the airport (e.g. Barcelona, Sevilla...), I recommend renting the car before or after, so as not be bothered by the car while in town.

The main car rental hubs in Mainland Spain are: 

* Malaga airport - see car rental deals
* Barcelona airport - see car rental deals
* Alicante airport - see car rental deals
* Madrid Airport - see car rental deals
* Sevilla Airport - see car rental deals
* Barcelona train station - see car rental deals
* Malaga train station - see car rental deals

## 6 to 10 - What type of car to choose
### Tip 6 - Recommendations for size of car / power - does size matters?
I know it depends on how many people are traveling and how much luggage you are traveling with.
But here are a few things to keep in mind when traveling in Spain:

* Size
My main recommendation is to pick a car that is not too wide
When you drive through historical villages or old town, there are some narrow streets. 
A narrower car will be less stressful.
* Power
Any size of cars will be able to drive all around the country.  
However, It will be more comfortable in the mountains, if you choose an engine that is not the smallest.

## Tip 7 - Transmission type - Manual vs Automatic

Most cars to rent in Spain have a manual transmission.
Rental companies have automatic cars, but they are often more expensive. And there are less of them, so book early.
On Discovercars.com, you can use the filter "Automatic transmission" on the left, if this is a must have for you.

## Tip 8 - Fuel choice - Diesel, Gas or electric

* Petrol station in Spanish is  "estación de servicio"
* Petrol is on green pump - called "gasolina" and if unleaded "gasolina sin plomo"
* Diesel is on Black pump called "gasoil"
* See the concentration of electric car charging station, where you are going in Spain on this website

## Tip 9 - Is it useful to have a 4WD?
Not really. Road to almost all attractions are paved.
There are a couple of famous beaches / viewpoints accessible by tracks such as Playa de Monsul, but 2WD can make it.

But know that even if you have a 4WD, the insurance protection associated with the rental probably does not cover use of the car out of paved roads.
This is frequent in many countries. Read the fine print.

## Tip 10 - Consider vehicles with sleeping options

Another idea is to rent a vehicle in which you can sleep.
Overall, this could save you money compared to booking extra accommodations.
In Spain, you should know that:

* Wild camping is not legal
* However, parking for the night is tolerated (without stabilizer and without taking anything out such as awning or table) - if there are no signs indicating that campers cannot park
* You can find campsites all around Spain

## Tip 12 - Things to consider when choosing your car rental company
* First, of course, the company must have the type of car your needs
* Then, check out the cancellation fees - on Discovercars.com, cancellation is free
* Authorized milage - depending on what you are planning, have a look at unlimited or defined daily milage allowance
* The pickup location - some require a shuttle to the get to the rental area
* And if you plan on crossing the border into France or Portugal with the same car don't forget to check if it is allowed - on Discovercars.com, once you selected a car click on "Rental Conditions" and head to "geographical restrictions".

## Tip 13 - Best rated car rental companies in Spain - reviews
When reading reviews, don't forget that on Tripadvisor or Google for example, anyone can write a review even if they have not used the company. 

On the platform Discovercars.com, each rental company has a mark on 10 points. This is an average of the marks given by actual customers.
On the search page, you have a filter to select only the best rated ones:

![alt text](https://placehold.co/300x200 "Logo Title Text 1")

Some of the best rated rental car companies in Spain are:

* Sixt
* National
* Alamo
* Enterprise

I have personally used Enterprise at Sevilla Airport and it went smoothly.

Compare car rental prices

## Tip 14 - How to save money - cheap car rental in Spain
If keeping the cost down is your main concern, you should: 

* Book very early
* Return the car where you picked it up
* Book a smaller car
* Pay attention to pick-up and drop-off times - Car hire is typically charged per 24-hour period
* Choose a rental without cancellation or with limited cancellation
* If renting for 6 days, check the price for 7 days - sometimes companies have a discount for 1 week rentals.
* Book with limited milage

![alt text](https://placehold.co/300x200 "Logo Title Text 1")

## Tip 15 - Check opening hours if picking a company not at an airport

If you are picking up your car at the airport, the companies are normally open as long as flights are arriving.
However, if you are renting a car from a town, especially a smaller one, they will have shorter opening hours (especially on weekends). This may mean that you have to rent for an extra day if you can't drop off the car.


## Tip 16 - Car rental scams in Spain

There is no specific scam in Spain, that I am aware of.

As in most country, if the price is very very low, then there must be conditions and tricks behind it (often at road side rental shops in beach towns).
And some companies do try to charge more for damages. My advice is to always take the time to check the car and take date pictures at pick-up and drop-off.

## Tip 17 - Be careful if crossing borders or taking ferries

From Spain, you can:

* take a ferry back to the Balearic islands (Ibiza, Mallorca...) - Ferry prices available here
* cross the border to visit Portugal or France

Most of the companies do not allow you to take a ferry. And you will be in big trouble if you do go and have a technical issue or accident.
For crossing borders, it depends.
Make sure to check the rules.

If renting with Discovercars.com, once you selected a car you can click on "Rental conditions" and then again "Rental conditions" or "Additional conditions" to find the "geographical restrictions".
If it is not documented, you can add the question to customer support.

## 18 to 20 - Understanding Insurances
### Tip 18 - Choose the types of insurance you need + requirements in Spain

Many levels of insurances are available. And their wording is often not very clear.
Here is a high-level overview of the different types of insurances - which are not really insurances, but waivers to limit your liability:

* Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) - It limits the customer’s responsibility during the rental period and sets the maximum amount of money the customer will have to pay in case of damages - 

* Theft Protection (TP) - this waiver limits your liability up to the vehicle’s deductible/excess amount in the event the car is stolen (proof required are a police report and the car keys). TP is frequently included in the car rental price. 

* Third Party Liability (TPL) - also known as Supplemental Liability Insurance, Extended protection, liability protection... - it covers personal and material damages caused to other people’s cars, property and even medical expenses. They have different limits.
* and many others...

**The mandatory** insurance in Spain is:  unlimited third-party liability insurance - it is automatically included in the price of all car rentals.
If you are visiting with your own car, don't forget to bring proof of insurance.

## Tip 19 - 4 ways to purchase insurance
* __Option no insurance__ - apart from the mandatory one, you don't have to take extras. Just know that in case something happen, you can be liable for your entire deposit.
Option 1  - Use your credit card insurance/ or your own car insurance
Many credit cards have some kind of coverage for rental cars. They all differ.
Similarly, your home car insurance can be covering you as well when renting a car.
You need to read all the fine prints to clearly understand what is covered or not.

* __Option 2__  - Purchase upon booking your rental car
When you book your rental car, you normally have the option to select the insurances you want. The deals are most of the time better than at the counter (I have seen 3 times less, once).
On direct websites, you get the dealer's insurance, but on platforms, you get a special insurance created by the platform.
For example, on Discovercars.com, they have their own Full Coverage Waiver Insurance Option
Personally, this is what I used. I know I may already be covered by my credit card and all, but this just seems the easier route, more straightforward in case of an issue. Personal feeling.

![alt text](https://placehold.co/600x300 "Logo Title Text 1")

* ## Option 3 - At car rental
This is the more expensive option, but if you have not done it before, you could purchase it as you are paying.

* ## Option 4 - Travel Insurance
Get a travel insurance that include comprehensive car rental insurance with one of the classic insurance companies.

# Tip 20 - Consider taking roadside assistance, if not included

Technically, it is not an insurance, but it is offered at the same time.
Conditions of coverage vary but they normally include:

* Loss or damage of car keys
* Keys locked inside the car
* Flat tire
* Rental car not starting
* Car out of fuel

If you are in a country you don't know, traveling alone and not good at changing tires, this could be a great option.
This is something you can get at the counter when getting the car.
